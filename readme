## Document Introduction

### Creation Purposes
This document or readme file / repository was created with the sole intent to allow quick navigation through my various repositories that I wish to showcase for a
portfolio, as github doesn't really allow a means to create multiple repositories in one or downloading a specific folder (project) from a folder structure I
determined that the best way to go about this was to create a central readme file hub that would link to the various repositories across my profile and then pin this
to the top of my page.

### Information About The Projects 
The projects contained withing are various small to larger scale projects that I have either worked on as 
    <br></br>
    A // Part of a course or an assessment
    <br></br>
    B // An idea I have acquired or something personal I have decided to build
    <br></br>
    C // Group project or jam I have taken part in. 
    <br></br>
As a result while I am mainly proficient in python and Js there will be projects or code written here that is not strictly in that. As of writing this I am proficient in
Python, HTML, CSS, JS and C++

### Copywrite / Licensing
All code showcased in this portfolio (unless specified under the actual section below) will be subject to use under the GPLv3 free use license.

### Overall Section Layout

To make navigating this easier I have included quick jump anchor tags for every section as well as creating this small section for easier browsing.
Each section (or project) will be setup like so:
    Project Name (linkable to the repository)
      - Course / Place the project idea came from
      - Brief project description (a more indepth one can be found in the project repository)

## Portfolio Projects

### [The Portfolio Website](https://github.com/ShaAnder/Portfolio_Website)

#### Original Inspiration
This project was one of the first from the [Udemy 100 Days Of Python Bootcamp by The App Brewary](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code)

#### Brief Description
This project is a website designed from the ground up to be a professional viewing into me and my work. While most of my code will be stored on github there will be dedicated sections
to more major projects showcased on the website

Much like the other projects in my portfolio this is one that shall be constantly evolving and being updated so it's advised to check back and see the changes that are made!

Here is the [Website](https://shaander.github.io) up and running in it's current state. For the actual hosting i had to strip away the flask server infrastructure but works the same 

For more information and how the project works please see the readme inside the project itself.

### [The Pig Game](https://github.com/ShaAnder/Pig_Dice_Game)

#### Original Inspiration
This project was one of the first from the [Udemy, The Javascript Complete Course by Jonas Scmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

#### Brief Description
This project is a simple GUI based dice game, it operates fundamentally through dom manipulation, with javascript powering it in the background. 

Originally this was designed to be a basic follow along project, however i decided to use it as a learning opportunity and broke down / reverse engineered the html and css to create a warmer
and more noticable UI. As well as this i did some research into setting up player selection functions among other features to make it feel a lot more user friendly.
