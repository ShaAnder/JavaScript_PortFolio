## Document Introduction

### Creation Purposes

This document or readme file / repository was created with the sole intent to allow quick navigation through my various repositories that I wish to showcase for a
portfolio, as github doesn't really allow a means to create multiple repositories in one or downloading a specific folder (project) from a folder structure I
determined that the best way to go about this was to create a central readme file hub that would link to the various repositories across my profile and then pin this
to the top of my page.

### Information About The Projects

The projects contained withing are various small to larger scale projects that I have either worked on as
<br></br>
A // Part of a course or an assessment
<br></br>
B // An idea I have acquired or something personal I have decided to build
<br></br>
C // Group project or jam I have taken part in.
<br></br>

### Copywrite / Licensing

All code showcased in this portfolio (unless specified under the actual section below) will be subject to use under the GPLv3 free use license.

### Overall Section Layout

TO make the navigation easier I have created a table of contents for quick and easy movement, as well as this the projects will be broken down into three Sections

Section 1 - Misc Projects, these are all the projects / apps / scripts I have built that are designed to be small or standalone things and not really deserving of a 
huge section on the portfolio, clicking the link will take you to a seperate readme / repo with all of them included

Section 2 - Course projects, these are all projects I have built as part of a course with the aim of completing said course; with a twist, for each project I set to
learn something new be it big or small instead of doing follow alongs, for example in [The Bankist App](https://github.com/ShaAnder/bankist) I took the time to learn how to build
a back end database with node JS and implement ACTUAL logins instead of using hardcoded data or in the MAPTY app I spent time learning how to properly do code refactoring and imports / exports

Section 3 - Solo / group apps. This is the main section of the portfolio, and where I will dedicate most of my time, it's where I am to create and build standalone programs and apps to 
showcase that I am job ready, They will be split between raw JS / React JS / Node JS and three JS.

## Portfolio Projects

### [SECTION 1 - Misc Projects](https://github.com/ShaAnder/Misc_Portfolio_Projects)

As I grew my taste in and desire to program more in javascript I decided to take on small scale projects to boost my practice and knowledge of the language, some of these are exceedingly simple, others a tad more complex. Overall however I wasn't sure if I wanted to create a seperate portfolio entry for them or stick them here in the misc folder. 

For now this is a link to a repo containing my older portfolio projects as well as misc things I work on for fun or to practice. Enjoy!

### [The Pig Game](https://github.com/ShaAnder/Pig_Dice_Game)

This project was one of the first from the [Udemy, The Javascript Complete Course by Jonas Scmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

#### Brief Description

This project is a simple GUI based dice game, it operates fundamentally through dom manipulation, with javascript powering it in the background.

Originally this was designed to be a basic follow along project, however i decided to use it as a learning opportunity and broke down / reverse engineered the html and css to create a warmer
and more noticable UI. As well as this i did some research into setting up player selection functions among other features to make it feel a lot more user friendly.

### [The Bankist App](https://github.com/ShaAnder/bankist)

This project was one from the [Udemy, The Javascript Complete Course by Jonas Scmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

#### Brief Description

The project is a gui based banking app with a backend that holds customer data

Originally this was designed to be a contained mock app, that utilized hard coded data to simulate a minimalist banking app, however upon completion I decided I wanted to continue working and turn it
into a fully realized mock app, for portfolio purposes. The current iteration of the app is that of which was found in the project, the next step is to create a more refined code base and to get a working 
database structured backend so people can actually sign up to and use the "app"
